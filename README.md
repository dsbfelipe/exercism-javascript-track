This repository holds my solutions to the JavaScript track on <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>, a platform I frequently use in my free time to sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Exercism, I highly recommend checking it out. It offers a wide range of exercises, covering various difficulty levels, across numerous programming languages. Whether you‚Äôre learning a new language or practicing one you‚Äôre already working with, it‚Äôs an invaluable resource for honing your coding abilities.

If you‚Äôve found this repository helpful in any way, feel free to give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate it! You can also view my Exercism profile <a href="https://exercism.org/profiles/dsbfelipe">here</a>. I hope you enjoy the platform as much as I do if you decide to give it a shot.

## üîç Topics Covered

The exercises span across a variety of core and advanced JavaScript topics:

- **Basics**: Covers the foundations of JavaScript, including numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays.

- **Numbers**: Arithmetic operations and number handling.

- **Strings**: Manipulating and working with strings.

- **Booleans and Conditionals**: Logical operations and decision making.

- **Arrays**: Array manipulation, analysis, and transformations.

- **Loops**: For, while loops, and iterations.

- **Functions & Closures**: Function declaration, expression, and scope with closures.

- **Objects & Inheritance**: Working with objects, prototypes, and class inheritance.

- **Promises & Recursion**: Asynchronous code handling and recursive functions.

Each exercise dives into one or more of these areas, providing practical examples and challenges that build proficiency in JavaScript.

## üìà Progress

Currently, I've completed 15 exercises in the JavaScript track, and I plan to update this repository as I continue to make progress.

## üîß Features

- **Organized Solutions**: Each exercise is organized by its related topic, with clear file structures for easy navigation.

- **Test-Driven Approach**: Many exercises are designed with test cases, allowing for real-world application of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

- **Continuous Updates**: As I progress through the track, new solutions will be added until the entire list of exercises is completed.

## üìñ Learnings

- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Many exercises challenge my problem-solving abilities, requiring me to devise efficient algorithms for a variety of scenarios.

- **Code Optimization**: With larger and more complex problems, I‚Äôve focused on writing code that not only works but is also optimized for performance.

- **JavaScript Mastery**: Through these exercises, I‚Äôve gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript‚Äôs features, including ES6+ syntax, functional programming, and object-oriented design.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with Promises and asynchronous operations, critical for real-world JavaScript applications.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** for solving the exercises.

- **Node.js** for running tests and solutions locally.

## üí° Acknowledgments

- **Exercism**: For providing an amazing platform to practice coding and for the structured exercises that push my JavaScript skills to new heights.
