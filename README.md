I've made this repository to store my solutions to Exercism's Javascript Track, which i work on my free time to practice my problem solving skills and develop my mastery over the fundaments of the language.

If you don't know <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>, i absolutely recommend it. It has exercises for a ton of languages that goes from easy to hard level that you can use to learn a new language or just practice the ones you're already learning or working with.
And if you're here 'cause you were looking for a solution or something like that and somehow a helped you with it, consider giving the repo a star, i'll appreciate it :)
